                     As I pen these lines, I vividly recall my childhood when my father used to ask me
to hasten to the nearby corner store to buy a few copies of the beautiful
&quot;Deepavali Malar&quot; special issue of the popular magazines of Kumudam and Ananda
Vikatan .These were distributed to a few known families as a Deepavali gift. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Although I did not know how to read Tamil, I really enjoyed the divine
fragrance that emanated from each page of the magazine, subtly conveying the
inner significance of the festival ie a single oil lamp was capable of igniting
several of its neighbours thereby forming a beautiful garland , without diminishing
in its own lustre.This beautiful special Souvenir being brought out to commemorate
the 2 nd Anniversary of the Sannithanam is indeed a lovely garland of fresh flowers
fragrant with deep love and offering of sincere gratitude to our Divine Lord Sai. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
When Lataji and Madhu invited me to join them on our first visit to the
Sannithanam, the tall majestic Gopuram of the Srirangam temple beckoned us from
afar. We were greeted with so much of love by Santhanam and his devoted wife,
Saradha, as well as Trayi Sainath. I showed a small personal pocket book in
which I had handwritten a few select teachings of Swami, and other inspiring
quotations. Trayi Sainath graciously responded with: <br/>

                     </p>
                     <p className={classes.para}>
                     1. A pocket size photograph of Swami, which carried the most appropriate
and meaningful message ‘PRACTISE ALONE MAKES PERFECT’.I realised that
Swami was gently reminding me that all His divine teachings were not meant for
&quot;Parayana&quot;, but for &quot;Acharana&quot;.No amount of Darshan, Padanamaskar, interview or
physical gifts of grace from Bhagawan will benefit us, unless we practise and
imbibe His teachings leading to self transformation and self improvement. <br/>
Every devotee must manifest uncalculating, selfless Love. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
2. He also showered Vibhuthi on thebook and into my hands. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
3. On the front page of the book in green colour was a sweet signature:&quot;With
blessing and Love – Bagawan Sathya Sai Baba&quot; <br/>
The following thoughts rose in my mind: <br/>
- Why the Vibhuthi prasad? <br/>
- Why the Green coloured ink? <br/>
- Why is the spelling &quot;Bagawan&quot; different 
from the traditional spelling &quot;Bhagawan&quot;? <br/>
On contemplation I realised that each of the above blessings perhaps contained a
precious hidden and valuable message.Vibhuthi does not refer to just the holy
sacred ash. The deeper meaning is &quot;Divine Glory&quot;. You and I are born to Glorify our
Lord and share our experiences as you have done through this wonderful Souvenir!
The Green ink also has a wonderful assurance from Swami. When a devoted student
asked in anguish, &quot;Where are you Swami”?, he had a vision of Swami standing
next to his scooter and asking for permission to ride Pillion with him . You will
be amazed to hear that their entire journey through thick traffic from
Indiranagar to JP Nagar in Bangalore was accomplished in a record time of about 15
minutes, as the several traffic lights on the way turned &quot;Green, green and green&quot;
as they approached each of them. Swami with a mischievous smile said &quot;Look, Swami
is always with you, if you venture on a noble path of Love and your pathway will
always be blessed with Green signals&quot;! Wow! What an amazing and Loving
blessing! Hence whenever Swami signs in Green coloured ink, He subtly keeps
reassuring us all of His Omniscience, Omnipresence and Omnipotence. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Finally, why the different spelling of ‘Bagawan’, I wondered. ‘Bhagavan’ or ‘Bhagawan’
is the common term used to mean God in Hinduism. The word encompasses Earth,
Water, Fire, Air and Space. ‘Bha’ stands for Bhoomi, ‘Ga’ stands for Gagana or
space, ‘Va’ stands Vayu or air, ‘A’ stands for Agni or fire, and ‘N’ stands for Neer or
water.When spelt differently i.e., ‘Bagawan’,Swami perhaps wants to convey
something further. The first 3 alphabets i.e., ‘Bag’ means to convey that, like Santa
Claus and his Christmas Bag of gifts, Swami rushes to our side with a divine ‘Bag’
which contains much more i.e., the 6 primary abundances or qualities of Strength,
Fame, Wealth, Knowledge, Beauty and Detachment. These qualities manifest in
the Vibhuthis or glories of God. God represents the best in creation.What about
the second part of the word i.e., ‘Awan’ or ‘Avan’? Do we not, in Tamil,acknowledge
God&#39;s infinite mercies by saying &quot;Ellam Avan seyal !&quot; (it is all Divinewill)? ‘Avan’ or
‘Awan’ also comes from the Sanskrit word ‘Avanindra’ meaning Lord of the earth,
One who owns the earth. In Hindi it means Preeti, Prema, Rakshakarna! </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Swami once remarked: <br/>
                     </p>
                     <p className={classes.para}>&quot;My language, role and purpose can be understood in a general way only by sitting
through the entire film, watching earnestly and vigilantly, and trying to get
the meaning of every word and act.&quot;
How true!</p>

                 <p className={classes.para}>
                 Bro. Santhanam had mentioned at the outset that experiences need not be
restricted to Sannithanam but can pertain to any other place where our beloved
Bhagawan is performing His Leelas &amp; Mahimas.The incidents I narrate below
happened in a devotee’s house in Bangalore.Swami has been very ‘active’ here for
more than 10 years and also communicates with the lady of the house and her grown
up son (Engineering student and a gifted bhajan singer). The regular prayers and
bhajans take place in the main drawing room that is spacious enough to
accommodate about 50 people. They also have a beautiful altar arrangement in an
inner sanctum, which is a small (10’ x 10’) room similar to Sannithanam. The majority
of the mahimas take place there.Devotees place their letters, offerings,wedding
invitations, pleas, employment letters, commercial contracts, real estate documents
and ‘what not’ at this altar for the Lord’s blessings. Swami responds in many ways,
each beautifully appropriate to the occasion involved. In some cases, no response is
also a response, as we all know. One sees Vibhuti on chits, on letters,inside sealed
envelopes, haldi – kumkum to bless auspicious objects, His written replies appear in
some cases, always in green ink. I have never seen a pen with green ink placed
there, but the replies appear sometimes on the devotee’s letter/ plea, sometimes
on a chit that he has materialized or has been taken from a pile on the desk / bed
in the corner.Let me narrate a few that I was privileged to witness.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
1. The first time that I and my wife,Latha, visited this centre in 2012, we picked up
a sheaf of bananas to offer to our Lord. Also visiting for the first time was a
doctor (cardiac specialist)who has been offering his loving seva at the SSIHMS
(Super Speciality Hospital in Whitefield, Bangalore)since many years. My elder
brother who is a senior office bearer in the Sri Sathya Sai Organization,
Karnataka,was the guide who accompanied us and the good doctor. There were many
other devotees, as it was a Thursday,who had placed their letters, sweets and
other items for blessings. Along with the bananas, we had also placed our letter
addressed to Bhagawan seeking His blessings. My brother had put an empty bottle,
after praying to the Lord for medicinal vibhuti for personal use. The doctor had an
official dilemma. The hospital was not sure which of the various makes of MRI/CT
Scan machines that they should finalize their order. So, he placed multiple chits,
each containing the specific make, brand of the machine.After our individual
prayers, the hostess asked all of us to adjourn to the drawing room for regular
prayers and the sanctum door was closed.When we went back after the prayers,
we found to our immense joy that the Lord had responded to all our prayers.My
brother’s empty bottle was halffilled with vibhuti; the doctor had his answer as
Swami had blessed one of the various options and our letter hadvibhuti blessings.<br/>
The bananas were also covered in vibhuti, even in between the bunch.I took the
bananas out into the drawing room to show them to the others. As I stood next to
the doctor and was showing him the bunch of fruits, I heard a ‘swoosh‘ over my left
shoulder and a sound as if rain was spattering on the windshield of a car. <br/>
Immediately, Latha and a few other ladies standing a couple of feet away
exclaimed, “Vibhuti, vibhuti“. I stepped back to see that the doctors head was
covered in vibhuti. 
                     </p>
                     <p className={classes.para}>
                     2.We visited the centre again on a subsequent Thursday when the doctor was also
present. Both of us were sitting in the drawing room, in front of the altar and again
I heard a similar sound, this time overhead. Again, the good doctor’s head was
covered in vibhuti, with some of it falling on the floor around him.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
3. Our niece was due to get married last May. We took her wedding invitation and a
bunch of bananas as a first offering to Bhagawan and the mangalyam (in a box) and
offered our prayers for His Blessings. Bhagawan showered his vibhuti blessings and
rose petals on the invitation as a sign of His acceptance. When we opened the
mangalyam box, we were thrilled to see that Bhagawan had blessed it with
Kumkum and Haldi, the symbols of auspiciousnes. Needless to say, the function went
off well and the couple is leading a happy life now. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
4. As narrated by Bro. Santhanam in an earlier dispatch, I had a heart attack
in July. When I realized that something was wrong I went into the puja room in our
residence and praying to Swami, applied some vibhuti on my
chest and put some on my tongue. Being a Sunday evening, my wife was at home
and so was a doctor who lives in our building. They rushed me to a cardiac speciality
hospital nearby where immediate attention was provided. (As Santhanam told me
later, Swami told him that we had taken swift action and He provided necessary
‘blessings‘ to take care of me. To quote Santhanam, Swami said, “I had to do the
needful“.Jai Sairam, He is aapadbaandhava.) <br/> The story became complicated at the
cardiac speciality, which is an annexe to a major hospital, but is still a relatively
small setup (though it is the branch of the famous Narayana Hridayalaya). <br/> The next
morning when my angiogram had been scheduled, they realized that the cath-lab
angio machine had broken down, along with the entire airconditioning facility. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Being a small setup, they had no backup or additional lab available. The main
centre is about 30 kms. away. My wife and brother were informed that the
replacement part had been requisitioned but had to arrive from Singapore. We had
to wait 24 hours, minimum. There was a discussion going on between them whether
I should be shifted to another hospital or should they take the risk of waiting for
the part to arrive, clear customs, get installed and hopefully work properly. <br/>
Meanwhile, the chief surgeon met them and assured that I was stabilized and
he took personal responsibility of my case. Though somewhat assuring, it did
not entirely wipe away the fears of my wife and brother, given the dicey
situation. Meanwhile, I was lying in the CCU blissfully unaware of the entire
chaos, wondering why the angio was getting delayed!!Latha and my brother decided
to approach Swami for His guidance, blessings and further course of action. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
They called up the Sai Centre and explained the situation to the lady of
the house, who very kindly assured them that she would place our prayers
at Bhagawan’s altar and to call back in half an hour. She kept three chits
addressed to Swami, in the altar: <br/>
a) Please shower Your Blessings on Madhusudhan <br/>
b) He should be shifted out of the current hospital <br/>
c) He should stay put there and await the repairs to the cath-lab <br/>
                     </p>
                     <p className={classes.para}>
                     When Latha called in half an hour, the lady confirmed Swami’s guidance: <br/>
a) The chit for blessings was covered in vibhuti <br/>
b) The chit saying that I should stay put and await repairs was covered in vibhuti. <br/>
c) The chit regarding shifting out of the hospital was left untouched and clear. <br/>
Needless to say, everything went off perfectly the next day, with the part
arriving overnight from Singapore. Not only that, the technical persons had a spare
also imported and were on stand-by till my procedure was completed successfully.
The blessing Vibhuti with the chits reached us soon at the hospital through the
lady’s son.I have also witnessed other miracles at this center, to quote a few: </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
· Once, the prasadam (Rava Kesari) kept at the altar showed signs of someone
having taken out a considerable chunk of it.Subsequently, in a few minutes,the
missing portion was found sticking near his mouth and hand on Swami’s photo in the
kitchen.<br/>
· A young couple brought their baby and laid him near the altar.In a few seconds
the child had vibhuti on his forehead and body. <br/>
· Another young child, a toddler,often would sit in front of the altar and babble
some baby talk earnestly with Swami. Then he would take a piece of paper and
scribble something on it. Soon,Swami would reply in ‘green ink‘
on the same chits. <br/>
· Many cases of letters that were kept in sealed envelopes being blessed with
vibhuti, though the envelope remained sealed, as confirmed by the concerned
devotee. <br/>
· Answers in green ink and the exact handwriting of Swami as He used to write in
physical form, to questions that are kept in sealed envelopes, along with
vibhuti, haldi-kumkum. <br/>
· Swami suggesting name (Brindamrutam) for Bhajan book recently released by
Brindavan bhajan group. Also, when my brother placed the first printed version of
the book at the altar there was vibhuti on it and in between many, many pages.
Swami had also made comments and put His Signature on many pages (again, in
green ink).Innumerable such miracles, leelas and mahimas have been experienced by
scores of devotees, enough to dedicate a book by themselves. Swami’s power, glory
and Love are endless and infinite.

<b>Preamble</b>
There are a few things, issues, questions and related explanations that need to be
addressed and I thought this is the best opportunity to take up those things and
place them on record. Why I choose to narrate these here is because, from day
one, that is from 26.12.2012, as advised by Swami the Leelas are recorded and
the ongoing follow up actions taking place being are recorded in Satcharitra. So,
there had been no opportunity to record items like what has been narrated here
under.As it is these items cannot be recorded in Sai Leelas-Satcharitra Material. <br/>
Hence we take up these things over here.Kindly note, the following materials
mentioned over here is a collection of various incidents, explanations, answers
for queries, answers for doubts. In other words these were the materials
pertaining to various issues/chapters in <b>Sai Satcharitra, Sai Leelas in
Sannithanam </b>. As such we thought this does not deem fit to be incorporated in
Sai Leela, hence have taken up these items here. </p>

<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Mr. Vasanth Rao </b><br/>
<b> One such question that kept coming up is ‘Who is Mr.Vasanth Rao’? </b>(Please note
this is not verbatim, but the question has been raised in similar tone)His name has
been referred here in these pages for several times, some individuals from Oman,
some of the newcomers &amp; others asked me this question. So, here we are …at this
stage we wish to take in to account only the most appropriate and pertinent subject
matters concerning Swami-Organization-Vasanth Rao and not on his personal life
/professional life and so on.. <br/>
However a quick word about him before we embark on Swami’s link. He has been
personally known to me since fag-end of 1984 or beginning of 1985 onwards, even
that as Sai Devotee-in Oman through Swami’s Organization.“A Mechanical
Engineering professional,with years of Professional experience leading various
MNCs at various levels, a Globe trotter professionally, having worked in Zambia
with Mercedes Benz and In Oman with SSB-Toyota, then in Bahrain, in Dubai-UAE
and so on, Sri. Rao is even now offering certain consultancy in Bangalore… “Now we
get back to Swami’s Organization- Vasanth Rao – and my acquaintance.I just wish to
quote some of the notable items, in fact there are so many but I take few to
illustrate the Vasanth Rao,as I know him, mainly, as a Sai Sevak. <b>One of the
trickiest areas in coordinating a Sai center is THE BHAJAN area. In my
experience, I call it as Skating rink. Best of the champion skaters that venture
into this arena would run into misery here</b>.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Way back in 1985-early days of Sai centre in Muscat, the momentum had just
started picking up, on a low key as used to be in any other Gulf country. During
Thursday Bhajan sessions, the gentleman who used to read ‘Thought for the Day’ (in
this case, mainly, it was Mr.Vasanth Rao) also had to announce that there were
weekly Bhajan practice sessions on Tuesdays and those interested to lead bhajans
may please attend that session. Those who ‘fitted the bill’ would get an opportunity
to lead a bhajan on Thursdays.During one such early announcement, it so happened
that the following Tuesday,at the practice venue there were as many as 40 to 50
devotees assembled,including the regulars who sing on Thursday. Everyone was spell
bound by this respnse. At first, all thought this to be a good sign and nice to see so
many attending practice. Slowly, the reality sank in for the coordinators. <br/>
 The first
week practice got over only by 10.30 p.m.The same story repeated in the
subsequent weeks. You can imagine the situation. Firstly, the practice sessions
were getting unmanageably extended beyond scheduled timings; secondly, the
supply (not considering the required quality) far exceeded the demand, so to
say, since there are only 9 to 10 slots for a Thursday bhajan. How does one
coordinate this, that too without hurting fragile egos? It is a herculean task for
any one. The best part - or the worst part - was, there were singers (socalled)
who sang only in the bathrooms,there were singers who only knew some sort of light
music and such varieties.Ragam, thaalam etc., was a mystery to them. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>In this setting came the beauty of a solution! Rao Sahab’s masterpiece</b>, I
would say. (I would like to add that subsequently, when occasions demanded,
I have quoted this incident in various places/forums as an apt example on how
to handle this type of spiritual congregation under similar conditions).</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
After having waited for 4 to 5 weeks,seeing that the aspirants’ number was
not only not decreasing but increasing every week, Mr. Vasanth Rao came up
with an out of the box idea to handle this situation.This is how it panned out; on a
Tuesday Bhajan practice session, Mr.Vasanth Rao addressed the gathering and
said;(By The Grace of God, I can do bit of mimicry, in fact I can imitate exactly
how he handled this situation – of course,that would need a video, but imagine it). <br/>
“Sairam to everyone. It is really overwhelming to see so many of you coming
forward every week for this session. I understand your real interest. <br/>
In this type of prayer meetings, Bhakthi and Bhavam are more important than any
other skills. Everyone here is blessed with so much of Bhakthi, so Swami will
definitely take note of this and shower His Blessings on you. I have a small
suggestion to make with regard to the bhajan practice (while saying this, his
hand went in to his bag/case), see this audio cassette, they are available in all
shops here, even in small groceries and supermarkets. <br/> Please buy one, just one is
enough. Probably you all must be having a 2-in-1 cassette recorder, even otherwise,
a mono type, just cost Rials 10/- only. (Remember, this happened in late 80s) What
you have to do, after you reach home, either today before going to bed or early
morning whenever is comfortable to you, place this cassette in the recorder, all
that you have to do is, choose the best song you like, the best song you wish to
render, the best song you wish to offer to the Lord, take a deep breath, close your
eyes, and sing.Don’t forget to record. After having done so, listen to the recording
even before coming here, so that you could find it easy to correct yourself. There
is no need for someone else to correct you,advise you and so on.Is that alright?
Does it sound nice? Try for yourself, before coming here next week. <br/> Sairam and all
the best.Can you imagine what happened after that?The very next Tuesday, the
practice session got over within an hour. You know why? Instead of 40 to 50
aspiring lead singers, only the regulars were there plus few more. Majority of them
did not turn up.Can you imagine what would have happened? Either, those that were
serious would have followed the advice as suggested by him and found that they
were far away from the requirements,or, they simply would not have tried it,
thinking, “The writing is clear on the wall so let us not risk it”. <br/>
</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Now the learning points: <br/>
1. In most cases, at various centers, this issue, this particular problem persists with
reference to Bhajan coordination.In my little experience of a little over 48-years, I find that
this is a tough area to handle. <br/>
2. Communication is a great skill – Many of the coordinators does not posses the same skill
as of Mr. Vasanth Rao. Many think that they are doing their job, and invariably fail miserably
in their communication. <br/>
3. Bring compassion to the task – Majority of the coordinators simply exercise their
portfolios without thinking of the human aspect and the psychology involved and so on…
4. Speak softly, speak sweetly - What we can learn from Mr.Vasanth Rao‘s style is, there is
no need to be harsh with anyone. <br/>
5. Careful choice of words - There is no need to use unwanted words. <br/>
6. Be gentle when correcting - There is no need to pounce on others even before someone
just try to open their mouth for the first time in life for singing. <br/>
7. All are equal in front of Swami – There is nothing like a watch dog attitude and a group of
some few ‘so called‘ Musical pundits sit together and look down on the others as though
they are inferior to them and so on… <br/>
The solution was very simple, perfect,straight forward and extraordinary,above all
without hurting anyone’s ego or feelings.That is Vasanth Rao. I can narrate so many
instances like this, but we do not have adequate time and space for inclusion.
Suffice to say that he has certain special ways to handle things/issues/people. <br/>
<b>Madhu</b>
As with Mr. Rao, there were pertinent questions about Mr. Madhu alias
Madhusudhan.Madhu is a software professional with specialization in Insurance
industry.Personally, we have known each other since mid 1980’s as Sai devotees in
Oman. Like Vasanth Rao, Madhu’s association as family friend and Sai Devotee
started with only Swami’s Organization and activities. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
When Bhagawan’s Sankalpa happened in 2012 with reference to Sanntihanam and
its Naming, Satcharitra, and allied spiritual activities, Madhu was named to be
included in the Satcharitra preparation, purely as per Divine instruction. Here I
have to mention, there were a few who offered their services for help,
provide assistance, with regard to Satcharitra from the beginning, but Swami as HE
is, only He knows who,where, when, how and so on.It is a fact and very appropriate
(it has to be, as per Swami) that He has asked Madhu to be part of this Satcharitra
and He kept insisting on this. In fact, if I start narrating some of the mail
conversations between myself and Madhu and in that case we do not reveal our
names in the text, displaying only the subject matter, and had I given the material
to someone else for an idea, they would say that both these individuals do not know
each other and are of different temperament and so on.<br/> 
Everything would appear
factual,unemotional and impersonal. The reason being, however closely we know each
other, when it comes to Swami, or Swami’s work, things are as per Rule book and
Madhu is the one who believes in that fully. Another advantage with Madhu here is,
he knows me very well in close proximity and my mannerisms and expressions, so he
is able to catch the intent behind the narration very appropriately.<br/>
Another reason
being that, Madhu is a long time devotee of Swami having been associated with
Swami’s Organization since long. Some of his close relatives are serving in Sathya
Sai Organization for several years and at positions such as state level coordinators
and some are serving in Parthi itself for several years.So, that is the reason Madhu
is associated with us in this activity.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Vijaya - Vahini?</b>
In one of the episodes in VOLUME -4, in narration, Madhu had mentioned, “even in
our Vijaya Vahini days” which someone has quoted and queried me after reading
the Satcharitra.This refers to our days of bachelor status in Oman (Madhu was
with his family then). Practically every Thursday,following the weekly Bhajan, we all
(almost a group of 5 to 6 people minimum, sometimes more) used to adjourn our
assembly over to Madhu’s place. There were many days of midnight discussions on
spiritual aspects, Bhajans,music, Swami and related issues and then we used to get
up early morning for Friday Morning meditation and so on. <br/>More so, on special
holidays there used to be continuous sessions for three to four days, we would not
even switch off the lights even during the day time, since the curtain will be
covered and hence the show continues. Hence, it was called as Vijaya-Vahini, namely
two famous cinema studious in Chennai. That’s what Madhu had mentioned in
lighter sense.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Trayi Sainath </b>
I just wish to pen down few lines on Trayi Sainath, as an outsider, leave alone
our Father - Son relationship.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Nature</b> <br/>
He is by nature, basically a very, very calm and quiet person. Never had I seen
or experienced any instance of this boy getting perturbed, behaving wildly or
with a bit of uneasiness with respect to anyone. As the normal course of action
with any individual at a time of some great achievement, one would tend to be
articulate about it and express things, events, experiences in a big (possibly
exaggerated) way. But in his case,believe me even I tend to watch him (not
from 26.12.2012, but even well before that) as an observer and appreciate his
calmness, his simple, quiet nature and wonder why and how I am not in a
position to carry myself that way. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Spiritual tendency and attitude</b>
Similarly whenever he visited Muscat as a child, invariably we used to have
Abishekam at home for our deities /idols. The day before such occasions, say
on a Thursday, when we went to a particular shop that specializes in Indian
Puja articles (M/s Haridas Nensey), no sooner than he got out of the car, he
would run towards that particular puja items section and pick the biggest jar of
Honey. This was because, if left to me perhaps I would pick up the slightly
smaller one. But he enjoys pouring the honey, milk and such puja articles
(abhishekam) and with much joy appreciate and enjoy the beauty of it. <br/>Right from
the beginning, if at all he so desires for something and run for it and
fetch something for whatever it is worth, it would definitely be some spiritual
related items only.Also from the age of 6 or 7, he has been the one doing all our
Abisheka Arathana at home in Srirangam, despite my father being around and with
myself too, but me and my father were allowed to only support him in puja and
only he would conduct it from that youngage. All Abishekams on special days and
other special pujas would happen on his own volition, without any prompting,
instruction or interference from us elders at home. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Appreciating divinity </b>
Similarly whenever he used to visit Sri Ranganatha Swami temple (famous
temple of Lord Vishnu in the Ananthashayana pose, in Srirangam), he
would enjoy the Darshan so much as to keep exclaiming, “Aha!! Aha!! How this
Perumal (Lord) glitters in His attire” and so on. When was this? All these even when
he was about 6 or 7 years old. Why I bring in all these items on record here is not
to support, declare or confirm with our little knowledge about recent
events/matters ( it is just not possible), but, just to try and connect to the
miracles happening currently and could be, or may be, conjecture on ‘oh
yes, it could be possible’.Supposing someone asks me “Hi,Santhanam why so much
narrative, can you put it in a nutshell in just one line?The answer is, yes, I would
declare:<br/>
<b>Nothing materialistic pleases him more than anything spiritual!</b></p>
<p className={classes.para}>
I think he is meant for this spiritual arena. This fact, many, in and around our
family circle, our neighbors, or some in Muscat who have seen him in action, have
confirmed with reference to current happenings. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
I can also add on a few day to day examples concerning him: <br/>
· It is a herculean task to take him to Pizza hut and make him to eat Pizza,it took
us several visits to convince him rather, to force him, though not desirable, to eat a
pizza. <br/>
· Similar case with Pav Bhaji and other chat items.<br/>
· Never have we gone together to any theatre or movie so far in our life. <br/>
· I can quote a lot of such examples,but for what? And one may ask a question,
what is the big deal about these things? My dear friends, I know of families where
grownups het into a fight. For what? Minor things like going out for dining, or a
weekly cinema, and things like that.If it does not happen for one week,then there
will be a divorce…these are adults..mind you.} This child never had such interests. <br/>
<b> Schooling and Studies, especially after 26.12.2014 and why there was a bit
of restriction on timing /visits etc.</b></p>
<p className={classes.para}>
He is by and large definitely an above average student. For the first time around
his 10th standard Examinations,we admit that was the time when he could not
concentrate on his studies,especially during the initial phase of Sannithanam
activities and during education, so on and so forth...“, he started lecturing
reminding us of the famous incident of our Swami‘s School days. For the first time
ever we noticed Trayi Sainath in some sort of angry mood and with totally a
different behavior. This is precisely one of the reasons, with Swami‘s approval, we
were forced to show a bit of restraint in our actions over there. (In fact, I always
think and realized after coming to Oman-Muscat again, that this could be possibly
one of the reasons Swami had made a swift decision with sudden arrangement for
me to move to Oman. Apart from this, every day I am finding new things are
happening, perhaps this is what is left over by me /for me to experience .)</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Mahashivrathri time. That was during the peak of Sannithanam activity and
within a short period of 15 days his annual /final examinations had started. <br/>
On one such occasion he came back from school, flung the school books, bag etc.,
saying, “No more schools, what A beautiful quote as mentioned by Mrs.
Revathi Sundar in one of her responses to our Sai Leelas Issue and has been
recorded here earlier. This is Swamis quote as mentioned by her. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
“See a person owns a beautiful garden.The whole garden is fully owned by him.
But whenever he wishes to rest there he looks for an appropriate clean and
correct place for him to rest and he will not rest anywhere and everywhere”.<br/>
The same is the case with a Devotee and the Almighty.<br/>
<b> Swami in Sannithanam <br/>
Swami is very active in Sannithanam.
    </b>
The minutest of things are being directed and advised by him.When I had left
Trichy, Swami told me,“Bangaroo, you keep narrating and record things as it
happens. Every now and then I will give you current messages too from
here itself. So don’t worry things will move on, nothings will stop“. <br/>
As per the
assurance of the Lord, if I look back - 01.09.2013 till-date everything is happening
as mentioned by him. In fact, every now and then,whenever I take up an old matter
for narration, immediately Swami will send new Leelas or communication which will
supercede what I had in mind and the other one gets delayed till the newer
ones gets coverage. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Swami’s “THE DAY” and concurrent developments </b>
It was the day of Swami’s decision to leave His body, 24.04.2011. Trayi Sainath
was here in Oman-Muscat for summer holidays. Early in the morning, I was getting
ready to leave home for work. I received a call from a Devotee conveying to me the
news that Swami had left His body. Immediately, I decided to take the
day off from work and hence called my Boss and informed him that someone
very close to me had departed and I am not in a mood to come for work. Trayi
Sainath was sleeping in the other bed room and the air conditioners were
on in both the rooms. There was no way for him to hear anything happening in the
drawing room. In a split second, he came out of that bed room. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Blessing Trayi Sainath on that Day </b>
He was visibly moved, perplexed. He said,“Dad, just now I saw Swami. Swami was
here..in this place..at home here.He came and put His hands on my head
and blessed me.Also he gave me Vibhuthi which was spread on my (Trayi Sainath)
forehead by Swami”. <br/>
So we took this in right earnest and only to very few I did share this information
few days later.I think one among them was Mr. Madhu when we had a chance to
interact over phone.Though that time we could not read anything into the event
beyond a point,but definitely a subtle message wasthere, I felt.Now looking at
Sannithanam and Swami in Trayi Sainath and related matters Swami has decided
that time only, that is 24.11.2011, or perhaps even well before, we may not know. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>The Parthi Visit </b>
In the month of May, 2012, our daughter Sowbhagyavathi Varshini got married. As
per our family tradition and custom, we engaged ourselves in various actions as a
prelude to the wedding ceremony; taking blessings from Mahans, Sadgurus,
visiting holy places, conducting prayers to Kula Devatha (family deity) and so on. So
naturally, our Parthi visit was also planned. Here the beauty is, self and Saradha
left for Parthi around 3rd or 4 th of April, 2012. Just two days prior to that Trayi
Sainath visited Parthi along with Balvikas children and Gurus, for a programme. So
on the day of our leaving for Parthi from Trichy, Trayi Sainath had returned from
Parthi. Basically, I make certain definite plans and prayers before embarking on any
project more with this type of visits. We chalked out our plans. I made my list of
actions and it went like this; <br/>
· To offer our Lord the wedding Invitation by placing it at His Lotus feet. <br/>
· I have few points to seek Swami‘s Guidance.<br/>
· There were certain issues which I wanted to bring to the notice of our beloved
Lord<br/>
· A small transaction between the three, that is, Swami-Central office-Myself
Having made the above Sankalpa with a strong Prayer, we were about to leave.
That day, early in the morning while on his train travelling from Bangalore to
Trichy, Trayi Sainath had a vision of Swami between 03.45 a m to 04.00 a m,
where in Swami told him that all will be well. To go ahead. This he told us and we
thought it is a Shub Sakunam, an auspicious sign, because, that very
morning we were leaving for Parthi. While leaving we requested him that at
Parthi in our two days stay, we will not be using the Mobile Phone and it will be in
silent mode; <br/>
if at all there was any emergency to please send in a message.As per
plan, we stayed in Parthi for two days.Though we visited Parthi earlier on several
occasions with number of days stay, this time around was a different feeling,
different stay experience, since after 24.04.2011, we were there for the
first time. We had our stay in or with the subtle presence of Swami. Within me
I was feeling somewhat convinced that Swami has taken care of my prayers,
<b>Swami answering the prayers /questions/ doubts/ thru a dream/vision to Trayi
Sainath</b></p>
<p className={classes.para}>
Now, the beautiful answers from our beloved Lord.It was 07.40 or so, The Mysore-
Myladuthurai Express was just pulling out of Bangalore city station, on our
return route to Trichy, my mobile rings.The first call I receive after our Parthi
visit …I am seeing that it is Trayi Sainath. Initially I thought it is going to
be a regular, customary call from him. But…..Trayi Sainath was telling me, “Dad,
today I had a vision of Swami, it is not like dream state, I am fully awake,
but Swami was telling me very clearly, as follows:</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
“Hai, tell your father, why is he worrying about things? He has surrendered to me.
Ask him to take it easy with things. I have received the marriage invitation, I
will be there. My blessings will be there.Then his other issues, letters, I have
received them all, tell him not to worry”.As he went on to explain the details, how
Swami appeared to him and soon..imagine!! I was in tears.. the Lord was answering
every individual prayer what I wrote on that piece of paper. Saradha was looking at
me, wondering what was happening to me. Later, I explained to her. In all those
above mentioned things,it is to be noted that Trayi Sainath did not know all the
issues that I was going to address to Swami in Parthi during my visit.
 The only thing
he knew about was the wedding invite to be placed at His Lotus feet.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
It was Bliss, Bliss.Later, in coming days, we realized Swami has already taken
control of Trayi Sainath or He is with him or within him. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Vibhuthi Manifestation initially on my hand</b>
After the start of Beautiful Leelas of our beloved Lord from 24.12.2012 at
Sannithanam in Srirangam (all recorded in Sal Leelas) there were a few things
also worthy to be mentioned. Initially for about 45 to 50 days or so, every day we
had tight schedule from 04.00 a.m onwards. Practically every day, while chanting
either at the time of Sai Gayathri (especially the 20th or the 21stcount) or Gayathri
Maha Mantra ( same..either 20th or 21 st count) I used to feel on my right hand, a
feeling as if a small peacock feather had run over it.Here Vibhuthi used to appear
on my hand. This was going on for several days.This are the same fingers, the finger
movement that I felt years back in Muscat while rendering that famous song.</p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>Vibhuthi manifestation over to Trayi Sainath </b>
Then Swami decided and told me,“Bangaroo, tomorrow onwards, the vibhuthi
manifestation will stop with you and Trayi Sainath will receive hence forth, as and
when needed (apparently by Bhagawan). So from the very next day the Vibhuthi
manifestation on Trayi Sainath hand started. I beg your Pardon,Swami please
excuse me, Swami’sVibhuthi manifestation started. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
<b>First one to receive was Mr.Natrajan </b>
It so happened that Mr. Natrajan (Al Raha-Muscat) visited the following day early
in the morning. In a split second he had the first opportunity to receive the
Vibhuthi Maha Prasadam from Swami.Thereafter, there were many incidents
of Swami manifesting Vibhuthi including the Bangalore trip with arrangements at
Mr. Madhu’s place.There were many such incidents as mentioned above. <br/>
I can keep writing on these line more.As such everything has its limits; space
and time also play the role.So, I feel currently, let me limit myself here and keep
the balance portion of the valuable notes, Leelas, Swami’s answers for yet another
document some time later as and when HE WILLS. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
There are still many like, why the change in name to Vasudevakrishna, why He said
that I have granted liberation to Santhanam, what about Swami’s assurance with
reference to Sri Prema Sai Avatar, what is the view of Swami on astrology and its
usefulness to one and all, how there are so many thing that this is our Swami and
His assurances, there are so many things to be covered but just not possible in one
issue of this kind. <br/>
<b>Last but not the least </b>  On one particular aspect of behavior of
some of the ‘so called’ devotees of our Dear Lord, is that they claim or act as
though they know everything on spirituality; they know everything about divinity
and its finer aspects related to human psychology and its requirements.Be it in
Trichy, or in Muscat or elsewhere, people made comments just
like that on different occasions.So be it! It is useless to start answering
with adequate proof and explanation.Water as it flows shall find its place. </p>
<p className={classes.para}>
There are innumerable case studies one can quote either during Lord Sri
Krishna’s or our beloved Lord’s time,many instances one can observe there seems to
be apparent contradictions. But one needs to go through the full cycle of
the text, be it Bhagavad Geetha or,Mahabharata, or Swami’s Life. You cannot
conveniently take whatever you wish to put someone down or to appreciate. Anyway,
it will be a waste of time if I start narrating such matters/issues.So I limit myself
here and thank you for your patience in hearing/reading.
