<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Though Sai Sannithanam was established by Bhagawan on 26.12.2012, this family,
Trayi Sainath-his father as Managing Trustee- of Sannithanam Trust, has been in
Sai Fold-for over 58-years… The first time Swami physically visited Tricy way back
in early 60-s, from then on…this family is a hard core devotee of both Babas and
has been consistently receiving Swamis blessings thru varieties Miracles manifestations… </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>

From 26.12.2012, Swami is with them in their living apartment…day in day
out….every micro second…every bit…every inch of their day to day life with
splendid manifestations…( all have been recorded minute wise---released in
writing in the name of Sai Satcharitra-Leelas in Sannithanam…in as many as 8
Volumes…now its all being planned to get in to book shape shortly).

</h4>
</div>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
There are so many Leelas / Miracles of Swami Baba with reference to Sannithanam & Sow Bhakya Sai Temple. </p>


<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Here I quote one of the Top incident (Sairam, Swami please forgive me if my usage is wrong it is to emphasis the subject matter).
</p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
<b>Swami > His presence in Sannithanam > His Leelas > Land for temple > Construction time > Khumbhabhishegam or Consecration ceremony and in each stage varieties of Leelas / Miracles….
 </b> </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
We had couple of meetings.One such meeting By Swamis Grace and blessings we have reached an agreement to celebrate the  <b>CONSECRATION/KHUMBHABHISEHGAM</b> 
ceremony on 21.01.2019.With the help of Pundits and Shivachariyar the future performing priest in the temple, we got the draft copy of Invite ready.
 </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Once it’s done, as it used to be in our traditional practice, I wanted to keep the Draft copy at thy Lotus feet at Sannithanam and obtain Swamis final approval plus a strange feeling to keep that in few more Holy places which are very,
 very close to me personally and to our family traditionally. Why strange is a simple reason,
  Swami Himself very much present, we could infer, perceive His Presence, Grace,
   frequently still some deep inner feeling that’s calling us within.
</p>


 <p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
One among the place is <b>SRI KANCHI KAMAKOTI MUTT</b>. It’s because of our family’s association with Sri Mutt for over 110-years, 
as my Grandfather was intensely associated with them in the level of convener for Muttrathikaris from the time Sri Mutt was functioning in Khumbakonam. </p>

 <p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
 Now another, thought, whether it’s right , 
 correct on my part to take this draft copy to Sri Maha Swami Sannithanam, 
 Kanchipuram, and how the others perceive this matter and so on, the fact being, both are Mahan’s, 
 Maha GURUS, and related subtle and intricacies involved. <br/>
 Once decided, if it’s true & genuine feel the God will answer, it’s my personal experience many times.
 </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
No delay, Next day I happened to travel to Chennai for some reason, 
though it’s not all that important, as I wanted to visit Sri Maha Swamis Sannithanam, 
I converted an ordinary invite for a function to attend went ahead with Chennai programme and the following day early morning proceeded straight to Sri Mutt-Kanchipuram. <br/>
(In between there are so many incidents, talks, interactions since more substance needs to be recorded I limit myself with this). 
 </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
My stay there in the Mutt was hardly 30-minutes,
 as my staunch emotional feeling driven thought is to place the draft copy at Puja Sannithanam and at the Lotus feet of Maha Swami.
 After a brief Dharshan at Sri Maha Tripurasundari & Sri Chandramoulieswarar Sannidhi quickly I moved over to Sri Maha Swami Sannithanam with little offering along with Draft copy of Khumbhabhishegam.<br/>
  It’s just a manuscript. Reached the Sanctum of Sri Maha Swami handed over the bamboo plate, 
  the elderly priest in-charge asked me the detail ( as He in turn will convey to Periyaval), 
  I told him, simply. I quote the very same words verbatim. <br/>
  Mama (uncle), this is a temple related Khumbhabhishegam matter which Periyaval knows all detail, 
  I need Periyaval Anugraham and His Presence on that day…. <br/>
  Respected Priest returned the draft copy along with certain Prasad back to me. Sri Maha Swami, Came, 
  Visited, Blessed the occasion, took part in the Khumbhabhishegam.
</p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>How? <br/> Let’s see now. </p>

<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Sriman. Mahesh Ramani is well known among Sri Mutt Devotees and those residents of Nanganallur-Chennai,
 the proprietor of Ramani hall plus, plus, plus, lot of excellent credentials and positive attributes,
  a perfect Gentleman and wonderful human being more than anything else, 
  I know him as Late Sri Ramani ji –his father and their family is part of this village Kandamangalam.
 </p>

 
 <p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
 I have been in touch with Sri Mahesh on several occasions with regard to Khumbhabhishegam ceremony and his eternal help cum assistance by various means. God bless him and one and all.
</p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Among those very few individuals whom I very personally insisted to visit and take part in the Khumbhabhishegam is <b> Mr. MAHESH</b> for certain unknown reasons honestly directed thru my heart.
 I kept on insisted him to visit village on this occasion. (As many know that he is very busy and in to so many Social,
  spiritual activities and the previous day and on Khumbhabhishegam day he has to travel to Thiruvidaimaruthur near Khumbakonam).
   But I was a bit, perhaps nagging !</p>

 <p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Now, the scene is set, </p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
21.01.2019, is the Khumbhabhishegam day, <br/>
18.01.2019 onwards the yaga sala, Yangya starts…. <br/>
On 18th Morning there was a Mobile call from Sri Mahesh, I ignored, <br/>
On 18th Evening another call & I ignored. <br/>
On 19th Morning another call I ignored. </p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
Why one has to ignore a call from a Gentleman? Answer is simple….with in me I had a fear, 
if in case Mahesh say, sorry Santhanam, I cannot make it for the ceremony, if it’s so I don’t want that,
 just that’s the reason. but finally he caught me thru another person mobile.
 </p>
  <p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
But it’s thrilling…. 
Here it goes…. <br/>
Hi, Santhanam, </p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
See…we will be there on 21.01.2019 morning briefly for about an hour or so at the <b> CLIMAX—KHUMBHABHISHEGAM</b> time along with me some more devoted friends are coming. 
 <br/>
 However, The key is the key message is.
 </p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>
<b>“WITH US WE ARE BRINGING SRI MAHA SWAMIS PADUKAS AND A NITHYA PUJA VIGRAHAM OF SRI MAHA SWAMI” </b></p>
<p style={{fontSize:'calc((.2em + .4vmin) + (.2em + .4vmax))',color:'brown', textAlign:'justify'}}>

My God out of the world scenario.
 </p>
